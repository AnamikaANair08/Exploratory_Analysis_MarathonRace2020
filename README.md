The dataset that I have used is atken from kaggle and have about 7461195 records and 13 columns. Here is the dataset name and its link -

Dataset name :- **Ultra-Marathon Running**

link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633

The dataset that I have uploaded in GitHub is filtered out with Country- USA, Year- 2020, race length - 50km/50mi. 
I used Jupyter notebook inorder to write the python code and libarries used are : Pandas for data cleaning and Seaborn for plotting the graphs and exploratory analysis.

Column names are :
1. year
2. race_day
3. race_name
4. race_length
5. race_number_of_finishers
6. athlete_performance
7. athlete_gender
8. athlete_average_speed
9. athlete_id
10. athlete_age

CONCLUSION:-
1. Males have more speed than females, even though the mean difference does not show much difference.
2. Athletes of age less than 30 tend to be more active as compared to someone at the age above 60.
3. More race tend to take place in Fall season > spring > winter > summer.
